      "content": "<p>This past summer, I joined the University of Virginia as University Librarian and Dean of Libraries, and Professor of English. This is my third stint at UVA, having received my Ph.D. in English here in 1988, and having served as the first director of the Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities (and as a faculty member in the English department) from 1993-2003. I am very glad to be back, and to have returned at a pivotal moment for the University libraries.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/facultynews.library.virginia.edu\/files\/JU_DA_01sm.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-115\" src=\"https:\/\/facultynews.library.virginia.edu\/files\/JU_DA_01sm.jpg\" alt=\"John Unsworth\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https:\/\/facultynews.library.virginia.edu\/files\/JU_DA_01sm.jpg 960w, https:\/\/facultynews.library.virginia.edu\/files\/JU_DA_01sm-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s much that needs to be discussed and planned with the faculty, including the renovation of Alderman Library, new Library services for the 21st century, new forms of collaboration with librarians in teaching and research, and your priorities for the future development of our collections. Happily, we have just been granted some Strategic Investment Funds to underwrite those discussions, under the rubric of developing a strategic plan for the Library. I plan to use these funds to create an inclusive and thoughtful engagement with faculty and students, broad enough in scope to ensure that the different needs and interests of the Library\u2019s many constituencies are fully represented, and deep enough to produce ideas that, once implemented, will stand the test of time. As we commence this planning process, I will be inviting you to participate in a variety of forums and discussions, and I\u2019ll do my best to make sure that these happen at a variety of times and in a variety of media, so that no one\u2019s participating is precluded by teaching schedules, research commitments, or travel. I hope that you will join the conversation.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, I\u2019m aware that the reorganization of the Library that immediately preceded my arrival may have broken some long-standing channels of faculty-Library communication, and so I\u2019d be grateful if you would let me know of such disconnects when you experience them\u2014just drop an email to <a href=\"mailto:unsworth@virginia.edu\">unsworth@virginia.edu<\/a>, and let me know what\u2019s not working, and how it used to work.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><em>If you aren&#8217;t already signed up,\u00a0please <a href=\"\/subscribe\">subscribe here<\/a> to receive email notifications when future editions of this newsletter are published.<\/em><\/p>\n",
